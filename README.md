## <span style="color: pink;">About Me üìö</span>
I'm a Business Analytics and Big Data major at IE University, with a Bachelor's in Business and Economics. My academic path combines business insights with a strong analytical foundation.

I am passionate about using data analytics to enhance business strategies and drive economic growth. Currently, I am focused on applying these skills along with my analytical training to explore innovative opportunities at the intersection of business strategy and data science. I am actively seeking collaborations and projects that align with my interest in data-driven decision-making and business strategy.
